2,"The Mental Health Surveys cover the population 15 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the surveys' coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Indigenous settlements; full-time members of the Canadian Forces and the institutionalized population. Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the target population."
3,"All rates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories ("refusal", "don't know", and "not stated") in the denominator."
4,"The 2012 data for 19 variables at the Atlantic Provinces and/or Prairie Provinces levels have been corrected. Data at the province and Canada level were not affected. The 19 corrected variables are: Any selected disorder (mental or substance), life; Any selected disorder (mental or substance), 12 months; Any mood disorder, life; Major depressive episode, life; Generalized anxiety disorder, life; Any substance use disorder (alcohol or drug), life; Any substance use disorder (alcohol or drug), 12 months; Alcohol abuse or dependence, life; Alcohol abuse or dependence, 12 months; Cannabis use, life; Self-rated work stress, days a bit stressful; Self-rated work stress, days not at all or not very stressful; Perceived need for mental health care, no need; Perceived need for mental health care, all needs met; Perceived mental health, very good or excellent; Perceived mental health, good; Post-traumatic stress disorder, current diagnosed condition; Eating disorder, current diagnosed condition; and Attention deficit disorder, current diagnosed condition."
5,"The Mental Health Surveys from 2002 and 2012 were designed to provide reliable estimates at the provincial level. MHACS 2022 was designed to provide reliable estimates at the national level and to sample a sufficient number of individuals to allow for relevant analyses of visible minorities."
6,"Gender was not collected in the 2002 and 2012 surveys. Therefore, the sex variable from 2002 and 2012 and the two-category gender variable from 2022 are combined in this analysis.  Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations. For additional information on changes of concepts over time, please consult the <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/014/98-500-x2021014-eng.cfm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide (opens new window)</a>. "
7,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories. Unless otherwise indicated in the text, the category “men” includes men, as well as some non-binary persons, while the category “women” includes women, as well as some non-binary persons. A fact sheet on gender concepts, <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-20-0001/982000012021001-eng.cfm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Filling the gaps: Information on gender in the 2021 Census (opens new window)</a>, is also available. "
8,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
9,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
10,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
11,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
12,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
13,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
14,"For the 2002 dataset, 1996 Census population counts were used. Evaluation studies have confirmed that the impact of this change on Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS) estimates should be minimal. For 2012, the 2006 Census population counts have been used to produce the population projection counts. These counts are used to ensure that the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental health survey weights and resulting estimates included in this CANSIM table are consistent with known population totals. For 2022, the 2021 Census long form population counts were used. This allowed the identification and selection of targeted individuals from targeted subpopulations (South Asian, Black, Chinese, Filipino), which is much more efficient than selecting dwellings in the general population."
15,"Beginning with the 2022 cycle of Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS), quality flags are applied to estimates based on the sample size within the domain of estimation. The flag (E) signifies an estimate with poorer quality which should be used with caution. The flag (F) signifies an estimate with a quality that is to unreliable to be published. The flag (X) signifies an estimate with a frequency that is too small to be published. When there is no quality flag applied to the data, users should use the estimated confidence intervals as an indicator of quality for the statistics."
16,"Data from 2002 and 2012 were collected in-person via computer-assisted interviews. Data from 2022 was collected remotely via computer-assisted telephone interviews."
17,"Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Mental Health and Well-being, 2002, had a sample size of 40,000 and a response rate of 77%. Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Mental Health, 2012, had a sample size of 43,030 and a response rate of 79.8%. Mental Health and Access to Care Survey (MHACS) had a sample size of 40,000 and a response rate of 25%."
18,"Data from Mental Health and Access to Care Survey (MHACS) was collected during a public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impossibility of conducting in-person interviews, the shorter collection periods and collection capacity issues resulted in a significant decrease in the response rates."
19,"The Mental Health Survey is partially based on a modified World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI). The WHO-CIDI is a standardized instrument for assessment of mental disorders and conditions according to an operationalization of the definitions and criteria of the DSM-IV. DSM-IV refers to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders used by the American Psychiatric Association. It is an internationally recognized classification of mental disorders. Mental conditions or problems are derived from a set of questions pertaining to the feelings, the symptoms, severity, the intensity and the impact relative to each of the measured disorders."
20,"Population aged 15 and over classified as meeting criteria for any of the measured disorders (major depressive episode, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse, other drug dependence (excluding cannabis), other drug abuse (excluding cannabis)) in their lifetime."

22,"Bipolar disorder includes respondents who meet the criteria for bipolar I disorder or hypomanic episode, which includes bipolar II disorder. It is characterised by at least 7 days (or fewer if hospitalized) of exaggerated feelings of elevated or irritable mood plus a certain number and combination of other manic symptoms such as racing thoughts, talking more than usual, excessive spending, decreased need for sleep, increased pleasure seeking activity, or exaggerated self-confidence. Many people also experience at least one depressive episode."
23,"Generalized anxiety disorder is characterised by a pattern of frequent, persistent worry and excessive anxiety about several events or activities during a period of at least 6 months. Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, shakiness, sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or restless, unsatisfying sleep), excessive sweating, palpitations, shortness of breath, and various gastrointestinal symptoms."

28,"Other drug dependence (excluding cannabis) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least three of the following occur in the same period of 12 month period: increased tolerance, withdrawal, increased consumption, unsuccessful attempts to quit, a lot of time lost recovering or using, reduced activities, and continued use despite persistent physical or psychological problems caused or intensified by drug use."
29,"Other drug abuse (excluding cannabis) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least one of the following occurs: failure to fulfill major roles at work, school or home, use in physically hazardous situations, recurrent cannabis related problems, or continued use despite social or interpersonal problems caused or intensified by drug use.  By definition, respondents who meet the criteria for other drug dependence are excluded from meeting the criteria for other drug abuse."
30,"Population aged 15 and over classified as meeting criteria for any of the measured disorders (major depressive episode, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse, other drug dependence (excluding cannabis), other drug abuse (excluding cannabis)) in the 12 months prior to interview."
